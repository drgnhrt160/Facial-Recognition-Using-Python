# Facial-Recognition-Using-Python/OpenCV

This project is a simple python program that can be used for facial recognition. It uses a Haar Cascade classifier to detect whether a face is present in the provided picture or not. Once a face is detected, the program uses LBPH.


Test Images have images that can be used to check whether the program is working or not.

Training Images have 3 folders; each with a set of photos of a certain celebrity. In this i have used pictures of Pewdiepie, Ishihara Satomi and Irrfan Khan.

Haar_Cascade has the classifier that you can use for frontal face detection.

faceRecognition.py has all the functions that the program might use.

FinalTester.py is the main program you need to run. 

If you run it personally in your system; make sure to change all the paths for files/folders in your program before running
